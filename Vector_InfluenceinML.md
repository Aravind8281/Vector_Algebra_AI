**Contribution of Addition and Scalar Multiplication in Data Preprocessing:**

1. **Standardization (Z-score normalization):** 
   - **Scalar Multiplication:** In standardization, each feature (column) in the dataset is scaled by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation. This involves scalar multiplication to achieve a consistent scale for all features.

   - **Addition:** Subtracting the mean during standardization involves addition, ensuring that the distribution of each feature has a mean of zero.

2. **Min-Max Scaling:**
   - **Scalar Multiplication:** In min-max scaling, each feature is scaled to a specific range (e.g., [0, 1]) by subtracting the minimum value and dividing by the range. Scalar multiplication is used to achieve this scaling.

   - **Addition:** Subtracting the minimum value during min-max scaling involves addition, ensuring that the minimum value becomes zero.

3. **Normalization:**
   - **Scalar Multiplication:** Normalization involves scaling individual data points to unit norm (e.g., Euclidean norm). Scalar multiplication is used to achieve this normalization.

4. **Data Centering:**
   - **Addition:** Centering the data involves subtracting the mean from each data point, which is an addition operation. This is often done to ensure that the data is centered around zero.

5. **Augmenting Data:**
   - **Addition and Scalar Multiplication:** When augmenting data, for example in image data augmentation, random transformations involve operations like rotation, translation, and scaling. These operations often include addition and scalar multiplication to introduce variety in the dataset.

6. **Handling Missing Values:**
   - **Addition:** One common strategy for handling missing values is to replace them with the mean or median of the feature. This involves adding the mean or median to the missing values.

   - **Scalar Multiplication:** Another strategy is to replace missing values with a constant (e.g., zero). This involves scalar multiplication to ensure that the impact on the overall distribution is minimal.

7. **Weighted Features:**
   - **Scalar Multiplication:** In certain cases, specific features may be given more importance by assigning them higher weights. Scalar multiplication is used to adjust the influence of these features in the dataset.

8. **Outlier Handling:**
   - **Scalar Multiplication:** When dealing with outliers, one approach is to scale the data using robust scaling, which involves scalar multiplication by the interquartile range (IQR).

   - **Addition:** Winsorizing, a method of limiting extreme values, may involve adding or subtracting values to set a threshold for outliers.
