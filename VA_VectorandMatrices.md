**Definition of Vectors and Matrices:**

- **Vector:** A vector is an ordered set of numbers, often represented as a column or row. In machine learning, vectors are commonly used to represent features or data points. For example, in a 3D space, a vector might be represented as \([x, y, z]\).

- **Matrix:** A matrix is a 2-dimensional array of numbers, symbols, or expressions arranged in rows and columns. Matrices are extensively used to represent and manipulate data in various algorithms and computations.

**Operations: Addition, Scalar Multiplication:**

- **Vector Addition:** Adding corresponding elements of two vectors results in a new vector. For example, if \( \mathbf{u} = [u_1, u_2, u_3]\) and \( \mathbf{v} = [v_1, v_2, v_3]\), then \(\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v} = [u_1 + v_1, u_2 + v_2, u_3 + v_3]\).

- **Scalar Multiplication:** Multiplying a vector or matrix by a scalar involves multiplying each element by that scalar. For instance, if \( \mathbf{u} = [u_1, u_2, u_3]\) and \(c\) is a scalar, then \(c \cdot \mathbf{u} = [c \cdot u_1, c \cdot u_2, c \cdot u_3]\).

**Matrix Multiplication:**

- **Working:** Matrix multiplication involves multiplying elements from the rows of the first matrix with corresponding elements from the columns of the second matrix and summing them up. The result is a new matrix.

  If \(A\) is an \(m \times n\) matrix and \(B\) is an \(n \times p\) matrix, the product \(C = AB\) is an \(m \times p\) matrix, where each element \(C_{ij}\) is computed as \(C_{ij} = \sum_{k=1}^{n} A_{ik}B_{kj}\).

**How it Influences AI:**

- **Representation of Data:** Vectors and matrices are fundamental for representing data in AI. Features of an object or data point can be represented as vectors, and datasets can be represented as matrices.

- **Linear Algebra Operations in Algorithms:** Many AI algorithms involve linear algebraic operations, such as matrix factorization, solving systems of linear equations, and eigenvalue decomposition.

**Use Case:**

- **Image Processing:** In image processing, each pixel's color can be represented as a vector, and images as a whole can be represented as matrices. Matrix operations are used in various image manipulation and analysis tasks.

- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** In NLP, word embeddings are often represented as vectors, and matrices are used to capture relationships between words in a corpus. Matrix operations are applied in tasks like sentiment analysis and language modeling.
