### Determinants:

#### Definition:
The determinant of a square matrix is a scalar value that can be calculated from its elements. For a 2x2 matrix \(\begin{bmatrix}a & b \\ c & d\end{bmatrix}\), the determinant (denoted as \(|A|\) or \(\text{det}(A)\)) is calculated as \(ad - bc\). For larger matrices, the process involves more complex mathematical operations.

#### Working:
The determinant provides information about the matrix's invertibility. If the determinant is non-zero, the matrix is invertible; otherwise, it is singular. Calculating determinants can involve operations like expansion along rows or columns, cofactor expansion, and Laplace expansion.

#### How it Influences AI:
Determinants play a crucial role in solving systems of linear equations. In AI, they are often used in linear algebraic problems, such as finding the inverse of a matrix or checking the invertibility of a system. They are essential for understanding the stability and uniqueness of solutions in various algorithms.

#### Use Case:
Determinants are used in algorithms for solving linear equations, such as Cramer's Rule, and are a fundamental part of many numerical methods in linear algebra. They are also employed in computations involving orthogonal matrices and transformations.

#### How it Helps in AI:
In machine learning and AI, determinants are used in areas like dimensionality reduction (e.g., PCA) and optimization algorithms. In PCA, the covariance matrix's determinant influences the selection of principal components, aiding in feature selection and data compression.

### Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors:

#### Definition:
For a square matrix \(A\), a non-zero vector \(v\) is an eigenvector and a scalar \(\lambda\) is an eigenvalue if \(Av = \lambda v\). This equation signifies that when the matrix is applied to the eigenvector, it only scales the vector without changing its direction.

#### Working:
Eigenvalues and eigenvectors are computed by solving the characteristic equation \(\text{det}(A - \lambda I) = 0\), where \(I\) is the identity matrix. The resulting \(\lambda\) values are the eigenvalues, and the corresponding \(v\) vectors are the eigenvectors.

#### How it Influences AI:
Eigenvalues and eigenvectors are extensively used in AI, particularly in techniques like PCA, spectral clustering, and solving systems of linear equations. They help in transforming and analyzing data in ways that highlight the most important features or components.

#### Use Case:
In PCA, eigenvalues represent the variance of the data along each principal component, guiding the selection of relevant features. Eigenvectors, on the other hand, define the principal components themselves.

#### How it Helps in AI:
Eigenvalues and eigenvectors are fundamental for reducing dimensionality in PCA, capturing the most significant aspects of the data. They also facilitate efficient solutions to linear systems and have applications in various machine learning algorithms where linear transformations are involved.
